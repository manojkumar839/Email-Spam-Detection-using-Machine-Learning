# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect whether an email is **spam** or **not spam (ham)**.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using Python.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text (cleaning, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine Learning models used:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Sample dataset included for testing

---

## Dataset
- The dataset used is a **collection of emails labeled as spam or ham**.  
- **Note:** Large datasets (>25MB) are not included in this repository.  
- You can download the full dataset from [Google Drive/Kaggle link here].
