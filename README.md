# Email-Spam-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam (unwanted, promotional, phishing) or ham (legitimate). Using a dataset of email messages, the project applies data preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms to accurately detect spam.
